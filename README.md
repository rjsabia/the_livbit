Livbit
=====================

Welcome to Livbit, a quick and easy way to find out who takes
Bitcoin. This web app allows you to search for stores or 
services that accepts this crypto currency anywhere in the world. 
Some of the search results even surprised me, like did you know that
there is a Toys 'R' Us in New York that accepts Bitcoin?

So what is Bitcoin?
-------------------

Well if you are new to digital currencies don't feel bad, so is a majority
of the world still. However they are gaining ground, as of November 2017 there
is a total market cap of over 200 billion U.S. dollars invested in them. There 
are also several hundred different types of crypto currencies. Bitcoin is the 
original though, and to this day dominates over 50% of the entire crypto market.

What does one do with Bitcoin?
------------------------------ 

Well for starters it can be used to hold monetary value, i.e. investing.
This is why many people buy bitcoin. However there are more and more 
stores and services that now allow you to pay for their goods and services
with Bitcoin. The issue is there are not many resources to search out who
does or doesn't accept it. Enter Livbit, a simple way to search for Bitcoin
vendors.

Functionality and Use
======================

At its core, Livbit is simply a search engine like Google (but much much smaller).
A user enters in a search term or terms. They can be very specific like:

- thai food
- travel agent
- pizza place

Or they can be vague searches such as:

- restaurant
- store
- food

Search bar interface
---------------------

===============================================================================

Livbit will then return the search results in two formats. The first is a standard 
list of found locations, the second will be marked locations on a map. Since Bitcoin
vendors are still early adoptors, you may need to zoom out on the map to find markers
or clusters of markers to see results depending on where you live.

Results list and mapped locations

If you are interested in saving some of your searches, simply sign up for 
a free account. This will allow you to click the star next to search results,
and save them to your favorites.

Technical Specs
===============

Livbit was only possible due to the gracious CoinMap.org API, a 
compiled list of locations of Bitcoin vendors. It also uses the Google Maps
API (with a custom skin) to show the users search locations. Beyond those two
API's, Livbit uses a plethora of web technologies so that you
can spend your Bitcoin, including:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- ES6
- REACT
- Redux
- Firebase authentication 
- Firebase DB
- Coinmaps.org API
- Google Maps API


Future functionality?
===========================

Livbit can succesfully run searches all day everyday in its current
form, however we can always improve right! Future plans are to improve the 
geolcation so that you can run searches directly related to where you are. I 
would also like to increase the features of the user accounts to include the
ability for users to leave reviews that other signed in users can view, as well 
as potentially allow Bitcoin vendors to promote their products or services to 
account holders. I also have some work to do on the original favorites section,
and would like to add more functionality to that as well.
